## 🧪 About

**PEXP** is where code meets curiosity.  
A collection of scripts, apps, and experiments that are born without a brief and grow according to instinct — no commercial intent, just exploration, learning, and fun.

---

## 🔍 Areas of Exploration

- ⚙️ Quick automations and scripting  
- 🌐 Microservices and APIs  
- 🛠️ Personal tools and CLIs  
- 🎨 UI experiments / micro frontends  
- 🔁 Integrations and small bots  

---

## ✨ Philosophy

- Build before fully understanding.  
- Test before organizing.  
- Explore without asking permission.  
- Accept that not everything will be useful — and that’s okay.
